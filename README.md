# Neural-Networks-from-Scrach
Created Neural networks from scratch, implemented vectorized code for optimization. The architecture built from scratch is also used on some data. This is my project/assignment from one of my deep learning courses

<b> This is my work from one of the deep learning courses I took </b>

Programming Language - Python 3.6

Started from logistic regression - a node in a Neural Network
Second step was to build a shallow layered Neural Network
Finally the dense layered Neural Network


<b> All the code here is optimized through vectorized implementations </b>
